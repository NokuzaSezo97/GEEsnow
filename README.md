# GEEsnow

GEEsnow is the repository for the demonstration of satellite-based snow and glacier monitoring using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and open-source softwares such as ESA SNAP. This repository is constructed based on parts of the training at the Geoinformatics Center: **Training on Application of Remote Sensing in Cryosphere Monitoring**, in 2023 and **Training on Drone Image Processing and Analysis for Glacier Monitoring** in 2025.

# Contents

* Remote Sensing of Snow and Glaciers (Multispectral and Radar)
* Brief Introduction of Glacier Morphological Features
* Remote sensing based glacier analytical indicators calculation, glacier mapping techniques
* Time series analysis of snow cover
* References used in the contents.

# Prerequisite

1. Google Earth Engine Python API  (Must be installed first) and GEE account.
2. Basic Python and GIS knowledge.
3. ESA-SNAP software (https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/)
